# 👋 Hello, I'm Emiliano Castro!

### 🚀 About Me
I am passionate about mechatronic engineering with a strong interest in science, technological development, and innovation. Currently, I am exploring the world of **Data Engineering**, while also working on **accessible and innovative biomedical device** projects.

I have also worked on **telemetry systems for experimental rockets**, **real time serial data reading in streamlit**, **signal processing with sensors like MPU9250 and BME280**, and the development of **mobile applications in B4A** for hardware control using **ESP32 and Bluetooth**.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++, B4A, Arduino
- **Hardware**: Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, IMU Sensors, nRF24L01
- **Data Engineering**: Data processing, storage, and visualization
- **Application Development**: Flask, Streamlit, Nextcloud, Signal Processing
- **Other Skills**: Team-work, optimist, photography, cultural management

### 📌 Featured Projects
- **🚀 Payload for Water Rocket**: Telemetry data transmission and processing using MPU9250, BME280, and GPS sensors.
- **🤖 Biomedical Device for Knee Rehabilitation**: Innovative prototype presented at **ExpoCiencias Nacional Tabasco 2024**.
- **🎶 Astro.difusión**: Cultural organization in Los Mochis that promotes local musical talent.

### 🎯 Goals
📊 Become an expert in **Data Engineering** and apply my mechatronic knowledge to develop innovative solutions.

💡 Continue creating projects that positively impact society, particularly in the field of biomedical devices and technological accessibility.
